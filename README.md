# Car Rental System

Welcome to the **Car Rental System** repository! This project provides a comprehensive solution for managing a car rental service. It offers features for customers to browse, reserve, and manage rentals, and for administrators to manage vehicles, reservations, and payments. Built using **ReactJS** and **NextJS**, this system provides a highly interactive and scalable solution for modern web applications.

## Features

### **Customer:**
- üöó **Browse available cars**: Customers can view available cars with detailed information.
- üóìÔ∏è **Make reservations**: Customers can choose their rental dates and book a car.
- üìù **Manage personal account**: Update profile, view rental history, and track bookings.
- üîÑ **Cancel reservations**: If needed, customers can cancel their reservations.

### **Admin:**
- üõ†Ô∏è **Manage car inventory**: Add, update, or remove cars from the rental fleet.
- üìà **Reservation management**: View and manage customer reservations and booking details.
- üí≥ **Process payments**: Integrated payment gateway for processing payments.
- üìä **Generate reports**: Admin can generate detailed reports for all transactions.

## System Architecture

The **Car Rental System** is built on a **ReactJS** and **NextJS** framework, utilizing a modern **serverless architecture**. The system is divided into distinct layers for clear separation of concerns and better maintainability.

### **1. Frontend (ReactJS & NextJS)**

The frontend is built using **ReactJS** and **NextJS**, providing a responsive, fast, and dynamic user experience. It is optimized for both performance and scalability, with server-side rendering (SSR) in NextJS to improve SEO and loading times.

- **ReactJS**: Handles the UI and client-side logic, including dynamic car listings, reservation forms, and user authentication.
- **NextJS**: Provides SSR for optimized page loading, routing, and SEO benefits. It also offers API routes for handling backend operations.

**Frontend Layers:**
- **UI Components**: Built using ReactJS with reusable components such as car cards, reservation forms, and admin panels.
- **Pages**: Each page, like Home, Car Listings, Reservations, etc., is a NextJS page that dynamically renders content.
- **State Management**: Utilizes **React Context API** or **Redux** to manage global state across the application (e.g., user authentication, reservation status).

---

### **2. Backend (Node.js & Express.js)**

The backend is powered by **Node.js** and **Express.js**, which provides RESTful APIs for handling business logic like reservation processing, car inventory management, and payment handling.

**Backend Responsibilities:**
- **REST API**: Handles requests related to car rental (adding cars, checking availability, etc.), customer reservations, and payment processing.
- **Database Integration**: Interacts with the database to fetch, store, and update data related to users, cars, and reservations.

**Key Backend Routes:**
- **/api/cars**: Retrieves all available cars, allows adding new cars, and updating car details.
- **/api/reservations**: Handles creating, updating, and deleting reservations.
- **/api/users**: User authentication and profile management.
- **/api/payments**: Integrates with a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe) to process payments.

### **3. Database (MySQL / MongoDB)**

The database stores essential information about customers, cars, reservations, and transactions. You can choose between **MySQL** (relational database) or **MongoDB** (NoSQL database) depending on the complexity of your data model and scalability needs.

**Database Schema Example:**

1. **Cars Table (MySQL):**
   - `car_id` (Primary Key)
   - `model`
   - `brand`
   - `price_per_day`
   - `availability_status`
   - `image_url`

2. **Reservations Table (MySQL):**
   - `reservation_id` (Primary Key)
   - `car_id` (Foreign Key)
   - `user_id` (Foreign Key)
   - `start_date`
   - `end_date`
   - `status`

3. **Users Table (MySQL):**
   - `user_id` (Primary Key)
   - `name`
   - `email`
   - `password_hash`
   - `address`
   - `phone_number`

**Alternative: MongoDB**: Use MongoDB if you want a flexible, document-based data structure, especially if your application needs to handle unstructured or semi-structured data.

### **4. Payment Integration (Stripe)**

The Car Rental System integrates with **Stripe** to handle payment processing. Customers can securely pay for their car rentals through the Stripe payment gateway.

**Payment Flow:**
1. Customer selects a car and booking dates.
2. Stripe payment is processed.
3. Reservation is confirmed upon successful payment.

---

### **5. Authentication and Authorization (JWT)**

**JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** are used for secure authentication and authorization. The user logs in, and a JWT is generated and sent to the client for use in future requests. Admins and customers are authenticated separately based on roles, ensuring the appropriate access controls are applied.

## System Design

### **1. Client-Side Architecture**
The frontend is designed to be lightweight, responsive, and fast. It makes use of **NextJS**'s automatic code splitting and server-side rendering (SSR) to optimize page load times. The application‚Äôs core logic is divided into reusable React components.

- **Home Page**: Displays available cars, rental details, and CTA buttons for customers to browse or make reservations.
- **Car Listings Page**: Shows all cars with details and filters to search by category, price, or availability.
- **Reservation Page**: Allows customers to enter their details, pick up and drop off dates, and finalize their booking.
- **Admin Panel**: An interface to manage car inventory, view reservations, and manage payments.

### **2. Backend Architecture**
The backend is organized as a RESTful API in **Express.js**, with clearly defined routes for different resources (cars, reservations, users). It uses **JWT** for authentication and **Stripe** for payment processing.

**Backend Key Components:**
- **Express Routes**: Each route handles CRUD operations for different entities (cars, reservations, etc.).
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Stripe is used for secure payment processing.
- **Admin Panel Logic**: The admin dashboard provides functionality for adding/removing cars, viewing all reservations, and processing payments.

### **3. Database Design**
The database is designed with normalized tables in **MySQL** or a flexible schema in **MongoDB**. Relationships between entities such as users, cars, and reservations are clearly defined to ensure smooth data flow.

- **One-to-many relationship**: One user can have multiple reservations.
- **One-to-one relationship**: Each reservation corresponds to exactly one car.
